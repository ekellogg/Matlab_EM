function [sim_mat,G]=sim_seq(algn)
% usage: [sim_mat,G]=sim_seq(algn)
%
% Returns matrices of correlation and similarity between sequences:
%
% sim_mat is a matrix of similarity which gives the fraction of common
% amino acids between pairs of sequences (counting gaps in the
% normalization).
%
% G is a matrix of covariance between sequences where each sequence of 
% length L is treated as a vector of size 20L with 0 and 1.
%
% These 2 matrices capture essentially the same information, and differ
% only by a scaling factor.
%
% Variations of these measures of correlation treating differently the gaps
% are conceivable, but they should give similar results when the alignment 
% has been properly truncated to eliminate positions with a large fraction 
% of gaps.
