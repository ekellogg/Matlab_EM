control_nodrift_correction:
simple summation of images with no drift correction, negative control

control_leginon_sums_nodriftcorr:
simple summation of images obtained with leginon, alternative negative control which tests the basic matlab utilities. Should be exactly the same as control_nodrift_correction

control_leginon_dfcorr_corrected:
en-a images obtained from old motioncorr algorithm, serves as positive control

liz test 1:
initial drift correction test with image summation in real-space and simple peak finding (max of autocorreltion map)

liz test 2:
added refinement of autocorrelation peak position. Did this by cropping out 16 x 16 pixels surrounding autocorrelation maxima, padding this in Fourier space and then using the increased sampling around the maximum to pinpoint the peak to sub-pixel accuracy

liz test 3:
added summation of images in fourier space instead of real-space. 

liz test 4:
also changed the form of the image shift fft function. according to frank's book it wasn't correct originally (scaled by 1/boxsize*apix) 

TO DO:
* b-factor function is definitely wrong. You are not using correct units for spatial frequency, which should be in 1/pixel. Yours are in 1/Angstrom. Need to fix.
* currently takes about 5 min per image which is too frickin slow. Need to speed up, potentially by converting to python code. 
*** check units all throughout the code. it's likely that things are not working exactly because your units are off.. likely in the b-factor functino and the image shift function. are you shifting by pixels or in angstrom? because your shifts are in pixels...
